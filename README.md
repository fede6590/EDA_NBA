# An analysis of NBA players in the 2021/2022 season

This project will rely heavily in the use of API as data sources. Contrary to most machine learning challenges and competitions, working in the industry usually requires the ML Developer to work with multiple teams and use heterogeneous sources of information to get the necessary data to solve a particular problem. Access to data is often provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), whether internal or external to the organization. It is very important to understand how to interact with APIs to collect data in our day to day work.

The sport is played at a fast pace, with hundreds of plays in each single game, thousands of games in a season, and with a relatively small amount of on-court players, which gives them a lot of interactions with the ball, which in turn provides an oportunity to collect a great amount of data about each player performance.

These are the objectives of the project:
* Understanding how to query an API to create a dataset with Python and Pandas
* Learning how to cleanup a dataset and generate new fields from calculated data
* Storing the created dataset in a serialized manner
* Generating statistics about the data
* Visualizing data
