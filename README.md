# AnyoneAI - Project I
## An analysis of NBA players in the 2021/2022 season

Hi! this is the first of several projects we're going to be working on during this course. You will be expected to finish this on your own, but you can use the available channels on Discord to ask questions and help others. Please read the entire notebook before starting, this will give you a better idea of what you need to accomplish.

This project will rely heavily in the use of API as data sources. Contrary to most machine learning challenges and competitions, working in the industry usually requires the ML Developer to work with multiple teams and use heterogeneous sources of information to get the necessary data to solve a particular problem. Access to data is often provided through application programming interfaces (APIs), whether internal or external to the organization. It is very important to understand how to interact with APIs to collect data in our day to day work.

You might be wondering: why basketball? The main reason is availability of data.

The sport is played at a fast pace, with hundreds of plays in each single game, thousands of games in a season, and with a relatively small amount of on-court players, which gives them a lot of interactions with the ball, which in turn provides an oportunity to collect a great amount of data about each player performance.

These are the objectives of the project:
* Understanding how to query an API to create a dataset with Python and Pandas
* Learning how to cleanup a dataset and generate new fields from calculated data
* Storing the created dataset in a serialized manner
* Generating statistics about the data
* Visualizing data
